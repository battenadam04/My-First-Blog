                <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                <p>Since I was a young child I have always been interested in technology, whether it was gaming, computers or everyday gadgets. I have always been a physical person too but that doesn't keep me away from the laptop for long. Once I discovered the art of developing and designing web applications I was intrigued and wanted to know more.</p>
                <h3>What I Do?</h3>
                <p>I am a Freelance Web Developer, living out of Belfast. I can create front-end and back-end applications from start to finish. I have recently used a combination of PHP/ MySQL and AJAX/ Jquery in recent projects, which lead me to learning Laravel PHP and OOP (Object Oriented Proegramming) in order to further reduce production times. I treat others how I would prefer to be treated, I do the same when it comes to a clients application.</p>
